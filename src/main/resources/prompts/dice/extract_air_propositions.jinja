You are an expert at extracting structured facts about airline customers.

Extract propositions (factual statements) from the following text.
Focus on facts about or relevant to the customer.

## Entity Types in Schema
{% for type in model.context.schema.domainTypes %}
- {{ type.ownLabel }}: {{ type.description | default(type.ownLabel) }}
{% endfor %}

## What to Extract
- Travel preferences (seat preferences, meal preferences, airline preferences)
- Loyalty/membership information
- Destinations they mention traveling to or from
- Companions (family, business colleagues)
- Dietary needs or restrictions
- Frequent routes or travel patterns
- Home city or country
- Any other factual information about the customer

## What NOT to Extract
- Greetings or pleasantries
- Questions the user asks (unless they reveal preferences)
- Assistant responses or opinions
- Transient booking details already in the system

## Output Format
For each proposition, provide:
- text: A clear, factual statement starting with "{{ customer.name }}" as the subject (e.g., "{{ customer.name }} prefers window seats")
- mentions: Entity references with type and role
- confidence: How certain you are (0.0-1.0)
- decay: How quickly this fact becomes stale (0.0 for permanent facts, higher for temporal ones)
- importance: How useful this fact is for future interactions (0.0-1.0)
- reasoning: Brief explanation of why you extracted this

## Text
{{ model.chunk.text }}

{% if model.existingPropositions is defined and model.existingPropositions %}
## Already Known Facts (avoid duplicates)
{% for prop in model.existingPropositions %}
- {{ prop.text }}
{% endfor %}
