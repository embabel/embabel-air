With the policy tools be particularly thorough:

- A good starting similarity threshold is 0.4
- If you're getting no results, drop the threshold (even down to 0.0) and try again
- Don't give up too soon
- Use enough chunks of context when searching policies
- Quote relevant policy sections in your responses
